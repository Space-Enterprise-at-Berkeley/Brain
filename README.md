# All Firmware
Contains all microcontroller code for any and all boards we develop.
See specific dir documentation for more details.
## Setup:
We use the PlatformIO build system. To get started, follow the
instructions on this page: https://platformio.org/install. You
can either install the VS Code extension, or the CLI directly.
Once it's installed, you can build the code by running `pio run`
in your terminal. Works on windows, mac and linux.
