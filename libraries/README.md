# Libraries
To install all libraries to the local arduino directory, run `./install.sh` in bash.

Use Git Bash on windows. On Unix, might need to grant run priveliges w/ `chmod +x ./install.sh`

We use the Eigen linear algebra library.
Follow the [instructions here](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Download) to install it. And Copy the Eigen folder to this directory w/ the directory name `eigen-3.<version>`. This dir exists in the gitignore and will not be pushed to our repo.
